# Crystal Collector Game

This game is my Unit 4 homework submission for UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp.  

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive game in which the HTML is dynamically updated using the jQuery library.

Click [here]( https://chrisboyce886.github.io/unit-4-game/) to play the game. 

## How to Play
* You will be given a random number at the start of the game.              
* There are four crystals to the right. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.              
* You win the game by matching your total score to the Number to Match; you lose the game if your total score goes above the Number to Match.             
* The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.             
* Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal and give you a new random number to match.

## Design Notes
* Gem buttons are assigned a number between 1 - 12
* Random number generated is a number between 19 - 120

## Built With
